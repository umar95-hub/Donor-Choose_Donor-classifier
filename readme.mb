The objective of this assignment is to predict whether a request for funding in donorchoose website will get funded or not. In order to do so I've used various architectures
that build using fuctional API of keras. 

**DonorsChoose
DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. 
Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website.
